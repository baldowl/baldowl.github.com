  <h1>What's going on here</h1>

  <p>Honestly, I don't know what to use this page for, but I know I won't
  build a blog, because I'm not a talkative person (and because public, futile
  rants <em>aren't</em> very much in demand).</p>

  <h2>Ruby &amp; Co.</h2>

  <p>Being mainly a system administrator forced by life into a web programmer,
  I chose the easiest path and turned to Ruby on Rails. After a while, I
  started using Ruby more and more, negletting sed, awk and the other tools
  who served me faithfully over the years.</p>

  <p>Enough sadness :-)</p>

  <p>At the moment I'm really interested in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra,
  Rack, Cocoa (but I'd rather not use Objective-C... go MacRuby, go!), Merb
  and Chef.</p>
