title: Rough gallery plugin for Jekyll
---
Some weeks ago I needed to build a small, static web page starting from a
large number of images. Boring task... copying and pasting chunks of HTML is
not for me, so I started looking for a suitable static site generator. I ended
up using [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/) but could not stop wondering
about Jekyll.

I know, it's better suited to blog-like sites, but I had some free time (it
was a national holiday :-)) and so put together a rough extension for Jekyll
which has already slept too long on my disk. Here's the code, without warranty
of any kind (including usefullness).
