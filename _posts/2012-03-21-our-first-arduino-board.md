It arrived yesterday morning...

<img src="/images/posts/our-first-arduino-board.jpg" class="centered"

I knew it was small, but having it in your hand is another story (and the
facts the the project started here in Italy and that the board is built in
Italian factories reminded me that, sometimes, we Italians are not so bad at
what we do with passion).

And now difficult part: I must try not to fry it or electrocute me :-)
