Today marks the first month into my new job at
[Shopify](http://www.shopify.com).

What a month! Not a single day's been tiresome: while externally Shopify could
seem a slowly moving entity, behind the scene there's a constant flux of
improvements, fixes and tweaks to the facing application and a growing army of
internal projects and tools.

It's a wonderful business to work for.

I've been so lucky that Alex, Dale and Cody decided to hire me on and I'm so
happy to work with so many bright people that during the last month I woke up
at least a couple of times thinking to have dreamed up everything :-D
